Write a story about your data. Illustrate with plots and also statistical analysis.  See the data blogs from the previous years published on data101 site for comparison (not copying!)   

https://data101.cs.rutgers.edu/?q=blog


a) Formulate at least one hypothesis and calculate p-value either by permutation test or by z-test for one or more of your findings
b) Write a post about it (best will be published)

c) Use plots to illustrate relationships in data



This is NOT extra credit.  It is OBLIGATORY  (there will also be one more  HW before this deadline)

Submit a post (WORD FILE to Canvass) - just like examples on the blog link of data 101 site (there are about 40+ blogs now), introduce yourself, tell where this data is from and why should we care? Best is that you should care (find your data set interesting), much easier to convince others if you believe first....

Since many asked - DO NOT attempt to submit blog through data 101 site. Submit word/text  file on CANVASS.  PLUS  also submit  R code you used to calculate p-values*  (thus, wait for some of this before we cover hypothesis testing)  and  (if plots are not in the word file) than plots as files as well. No power points are needed this time. 

 anticipate questions:

so what? And is your evidence good enough?  may be it is all random? Or may be there is missing variable? Or your sample was biased?   Or how else could you have been possibly fooled by your data?  

What about data source - is it trustworthy?

Submit your plots + your code (usual R as txt or .r file).
